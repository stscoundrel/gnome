# Gnome

A housekeeper gnome to sort through your messy desktop.

Essentially just cleanup for your overflowing image files & screenshots. Moves both to their own subfolders, keeping your desktop clean.



## Usage

- Run the script anywhere.
- Desktop location will be automatically detected & cleaned of image files.
- Example output: `Gnome has finished cleaning up the desktop. Moved 76 images and 362 screenshots`.

## Why though?

I might've cluttered couple of different machines with hundreds of images on their respective desktops.
